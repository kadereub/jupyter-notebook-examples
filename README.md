## Files

1. **Luno_Bitstamp_Arb_Analysis** - Illustrating some high-level crypto arbitrage opportunites that existed in the early days between SA's Luno exchange and the EU's Bitstamp.

2. **Time Series Tail Analysis** - Visualising *tail* events in which the day on day move of the equity price of a firm falls within the tail end of the distribution.

3. **Internal Rate of Return Discussion** - Recently came across the instability of the irr function in `numpy` and thought it would be interesting to investigate various alternatives in the `python` universe.
