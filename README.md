A collection of notebooks with some python code of random projects

## Files

1. **Luno_Bitstamp_Arb_Analysis** - Illustrating some high-level crypto arbitrage opportunites that existed in the early days between SA's Luno exchange and the EU's Bitstamp.

2. **Time Series Tail Analysis** - Visualising *tail* events in which the day on day move of the equity price of a firm falls within the tail end of the distribution.

3. **Internal Rate of Return Discussion** - Recently came across the instability of the irr function in `numpy` and thought it would be interesting to investigate various alternatives in the `python` universe.


3. **bitcoin_tick_data_visualisation** - Recently came across this amazing tick [data source](http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/) for bitcoin, and it's accurate, no data gaps! I created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/kadereub/28e82f5c96d81574a53042fbf625995a) showing how to process and download it, however just wanted to visualize the data a bit and illustate `plotly`'s awesome candlestick functionality.
